# Managed Hosting

This repository is the open-source SatGate proxy + SDKs + docs.

If you’re looking for a managed/hosted offering, that lives outside this OSS repository.

## Features

- **Zero ops** — No Lightning node required
- **Instant setup** — Create a project in 60 seconds
- **Multi-tenant gateway** — Your subdomain (yourapi.satgate.cloud)
- **Dashboard** — Real-time analytics and earnings
- **Payouts** — Withdraw to Lightning Address
- **Billing** — Pay with Lightning (annual) or Stripe (monthly)

## Self-Hosted Alternative

If you prefer to run your own infrastructure:

1. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the gateway design
2. Follow [gateway/DEPLOY_SELF_HOSTED.md](./gateway/DEPLOY_SELF_HOSTED.md) for deployment
3. Use the Docker configs in `/docker/`

## Support
